# Self-Driving-Level-0

## Overview
Self-Driving-Level-0 is an innovative vehicle design project that integrates object detection to maneuver around obstacles autonomously. This project represents the foundational technology for self-driving vehicles at the most basic level (Level 0), where automation is used to enhance specific functions such as obstacle avoidance.

## Vehicle Composition
The vehicle is engineered with the following components:
- **Motor**: Powers the rear wheel axles, propelling the vehicle forward.
- **Steering Mechanism**: Front-wheel steer blocks that provide precise direction control.
- **Object Detection**: Front-mounted sensors to identify and react to obstacles.
- **Signal Indicator**: A programmable LED that activates upon detecting prompts.

## Functionality
The vehicle's steering actions are fully programmable, responding to specific input values which allow for dynamic obstacle avoidance maneuvers.

## Simulation Environment
The project is virtually tested within the "World of Contraptions" platform, a physics-based simulation environment by JCP Games Studio, to ensure the effectiveness of the design in a controlled setting.
